OneProgramOneDay
================
  In order to get more pressure to study harder, I copy the Jen Dewalt's pratice 'one website per day'.
  No matter what the result it is, I just want to challenge my self to the extreme capability.
  So I've made this mad dicision. It won't be crazy enough for me to be an expert programmer. 
  It will take me a year or so, And I'll do all I could to make it come ture!
