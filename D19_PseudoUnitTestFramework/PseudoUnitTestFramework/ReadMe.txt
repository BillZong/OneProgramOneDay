This project is programmed in Visual Studio 2008, using C++.
I'm trying to copy the Google C++ Unit Test Framework in the simplest way. The source is from http://www.cnblogs.com/coderzh/archive/2009/04/12/1434155.html, I've only made a little change to let it work in Windows.
The macro is the hardest point in this program. You'd better expand them to check it right or not.
